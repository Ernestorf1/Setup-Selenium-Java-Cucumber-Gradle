# Setup-Selenium-Java-Cucumber-Gradle
"Setup Selenium-Java-Cucumber-Gradle" is a project that contains a set of configurations and source code files required to start working with Selenium WebDriver in Java using the Cucumber testing framework and the Gradle dependency management tool.
### Gradle Configuration:
The repository would contain Gradle configuration files, such as `build.gradle`, specifying project dependencies, build and execution tasks, and other relevant settings for building and running the project.

### Selenium and WebDriver Dependencies:
It would include dependencies for Selenium WebDriver and any necessary browser drivers (such as ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver for Firefox, etc.). These dependencies would be specified in the `build.gradle` file.

### Test Code:
A set of Java source code files containing example tests using Selenium WebDriver and the Cucumber testing framework would be provided. This may include step definition files (`Step Definitions`), feature files (`Feature Files`) describing the expected behavior of the software, and any additional supporting classes necessary for test execution.

### Cucumber Configuration:
The necessary configuration for running Cucumber-based tests would be included, such as specifying locations of feature files and step definitions.
